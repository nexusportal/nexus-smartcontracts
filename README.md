## Primary Smart Contract and UI Components

### NEXUS TOKEN
The NEXU token has a 1.1 Billion max supply. It is Minted by the NexusGenerator starting at 5 NEXU per block and slowly decreasing in distribution rate over time (similar to the Bitcoin Halving mechanism). 90% of these newly minted NEXU rewards go to liquidity providers and 10% of the NEXU minted goes to the Nexus Core Multi-Staking. NEXU Token can be staked by itself or paired with an NFT in the Nexus Core Multi-Staking. Users can time-lock their NEXU and NFTs to gain multipliers in their share of the pool. The NEXU Token will be used to Govern The Nexus.

### NEXUS GENERATOR(Yield Farming Contract)
This is where users can stake their liquidity tokens ($NLPs) to earn $NEXU and potentially more Superfarm Rewards.

### NEXUS FACTORY
Swapping Contract/Liquidity Token Manager. Fees generated by the Factory contract are sent to the NexusDiffuser to be distributed back to users.

### NEXUS ROUTER
Routes Paths for Token Swaps.

### NEXUS LIQUIDITY TOKENS $NLP
Liquidity Tokens represent different tokens pairs created by the community.

### NEXUS DIFFUSER
The Nexus Diffuser receives $NLPs of different kinds from the Nexus Factory setFeeToo. The Diffuser buys and burns $NEXU with some of those $NLPs (primarily WXRP/NEXU). The rest of the $NLPs are and sent to the Nexus Core Multi-Staking to be distributed proportionally to $NEXU/$ETHER Stakers.

### NEXUS ETHEREALS NFTS
There are 11,111 AI Generated Nexus Ethereal NFTs! Each NFT holds a share of the Nexus Core Multi-Staking pool. NFTs can be staked in the Nexus Core Multi-Staking system to earn NEXU token and NLPs.

### NEXUS NFT WEIGHTS
The Nexus NFT weights are stored in this smart contract. The Nexus Core Multi-Staking gets the weight values from here so it knows how to distribute the rewards to the users.

### NEXUS CORE MULTISTAKING
The Nexus Core is where users can stake and time-lock their $NEXU Tokens and Nexus NFTs to earn $NEXU, $NLPs and potentially other Tokens from many different sources. Some sources may including fees from Superfarm deposits and

### NEXUS CORE MULTISTAKING DISTRIBUTOR
The Nexus Core Multi-Staking Distributor acts as a proxy contract for the different ERC-20 and Native token distributions. This is a security measure to make sure no one can take advantage of the Multi-Staking Contract rewards distribution. The "Distribute" button is publicly called by users to distribute rewards.

## Hardhat Deployment 🚀

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
